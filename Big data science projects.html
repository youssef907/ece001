    <h1>Big data science projetcs</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">1. Classify 1994 Census Income Data
One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on big data projects for students is working on this project. You will have to build a model to predict if the income of an individual in the US is more or less than $50,000 based on the data available.

A person’s income depends on a lot of factors, and you’ll have to take into account every one of them.

    You can find the data for this project here.</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">2. Analyze Crime Rates in Chicago
Law enforcement agencies take the help of big data to find patterns in the crimes taking place. Doing this helps the agencies in predicting future events and helps them in mitigating the crime rates.

You will have to find patterns, create models, and then validate your model.

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">3. Text Mining Project
This is one of the excellent deep learning project ideas for beginners. Text mining is in high demand, and it will help you a lot in showcasing your strengths as a data scientist. In this project, you will have to perform text analysis and visualization of the provided documents.  

You will have to use Natural Language Process Techniques for this task.

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">4. Big Data for cybersecurity
big data projects

This project will investigate the long-term and time-invariant dependence relationships in large volumes of data. The main aim of this Big Data project is to combat real-world cybersecurity problems by exploiting vulnerability disclosure trends with complex multivariate time series data. This cybersecurity project seeks to establish an innovative and robust statistical framework to help you gain an in-depth understanding of the disclosure dynamics and their intriguing dependence structures.</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">5. Health status prediction
This is one of the interesting big data project ideas. This Big Data project is designed to predict the health status based on massive datasets. It will involve the creation of a machine learning model that can accurately classify users according to their health attributes to qualify them as having or not having heart diseases. Decision trees are the best machine learning method for classification, and hence, it is the ideal prediction tool for this project. The feature selection approach will help enhance the classification accuracy of the ML model.</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">6. Anomaly detection in cloud servers
In this project, an anomaly detection approach will be implemented for streaming large datasets. The proposed project will detect anomalies in cloud servers by leveraging two core algorithms – state summarization and novel nested-arc hidden semi-Markov model (NAHSMM). While state summarization will extract usage behaviour reflective states from raw sequences, NAHSMM will create an anomaly detection algorithm with a forensic module to obtain the normal behaviour threshold in the training phase.</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">7. Recruitment for Big Data job profiles
Recruitment is a challenging job responsibility of the HR department of any company. Here, we’ll create a Big Data project that can analyze vast amounts of data gathered from real-world job posts published online. The project involves three steps:

Identify four Big Data job families in the given dataset.
Identify nine homogeneous groups of Big Data skills that are highly valued by companies. 
Characterize each Big Data job family according to the level of competence required for each Big Data skill set.
The goal of this project is to help the HR department find better recruitments for Big Data job roles.</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">8. Malicious user detection in Big Data collection
This is one of the trending deep learning project ideas. When talking about Big Data collections, the trustworthiness (reliability) of users is of supreme importance. In this project, we will calculate the reliability factor of users in a given Big Data collection. To achieve this, the project will divide the trustworthiness into familiarity and similarity trustworthiness. Furthermore, it will divide all the participants into small groups according to the similarity trustworthiness factor and then calculate the trustworthiness of each group separately to reduce the computational complexity. This grouping strategy allows the project to represent the trust level of a particular group as a whole. </h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">9. Tourist behaviour analysis
This is one of the excellent big data project ideas. This Big Data project is designed to analyze the tourist behaviour to identify tourists’ interests and most visited locations and accordingly, predict future tourism demands. The project involves four steps: 

big data projects

Textual metadata processing to extract a list of interest candidates from geotagged pictures. 
Geographical data clustering to identify popular tourist locations for each of the identified tourist interests. 
Representative photo identification for each tourist interest. 
Time series modelling to construct a time series data by counting the number of tourists on a monthly basis. </h1>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5vw">10. Credit Scoring
big data project ideas topics

This project seeks to explore the value of Big Data for credit scoring. The primary idea behind this project is to investigate the performance of both statistical and economic models. To do so, it will use a unique combination of datasets that contains call-detail records along with the credit and debit account information of customers for creating appropriate scorecards for credit card applicants. This will help to predict the creditworthiness of credit card applicants.</h1>
